\description{
Construct the path to a file in the TAF bootstrap data folder
from components in a platform-independent way.  This function
checks to see if R is running in the bootstrap folder - i.e.
`taf.bootstrap()` is running, and adjusts the path accordingly.
}
\details{
This function, simplifies the construction of file paths to
inintial data files gathered during the TAF bootstrapping step.
In addition, this function is useful when developing scripts used
in the bootstrap procedure, as these scripts are run with the
working directory set to the bootstrap folder, and hence make it
to develop and debug.
